# Limbs Safety Switch library Requirements

---  

## Environment Analysis
At this point in history, start of the 21st century, as new and soon to be released industrial production machinery models equipped with electronic smart interconnected controls make their way into the market, a big proportion of the machines currently in use in small and medium sized industries (even more in "third world countries") are still fully electro-mechanical devices with simple  -mostly non-existent- personal security enforcement and production information or control of any kind. The idea of providing those machines with an appropriate security mechanisms for the operators is relevant as great part of their active production mechanisms are not that different from last generation's machines, so extending their productive life while setting them to the required security levels expected in nowadays machines is a cost effective, investment wise alternative to changing every machine to new models.  

That benefit is technologically achievable at a reasonable low by the use of electronic smart controls to guarantee that target security level. 

But that's just the starting point for a deeper path into production modernization.  

Once the physical security of the operator is ensured, having a programmable device installed and connected to the actionable mechanisms of the machine opens the door to the multiple benefits the modern controlled machines offer: production control and improvement, time and energy use optimization, machine failure prediction and detection, data generation for analysis, locally, remotely, in real-time or deferred mode, done by the use of IoT technologies. As was stated: **once the programmable device is properly installed and connected**.  

Being the technical diversity and mechanical construction variety of the machines involved so extensive, not all of them will have the same possibilities to incorporate the required devices to achieve all the functionalities with the same ease.  
With those factors considered, the requirements for the solution will take a minimalistic basic approach, and then will be modified, adapted and extended as technically and physically possible.  

The addition of smart electronic solutions for the information generation, gathering and transmission is an economic, practical, achievable solution for lowering operating costs, by extending the machine service lifetime, improving their productivity levels, and then shortening the return of investment time.

## Definitions:

### Industrial mechanical production cycle machines and devices:
Are machines that perform a series of mechanical operations in a repeating sequence: the **production cycle**. The machine's mechanical power source (usually electric motor) is activated in advance and a coupling mechanism release -trigger- starts a sequence of actions for the production that ends with the machine in the same state and position it started from, usually involving a mechanical detaching mechanism. Many of these machines have no way of stopping it's production cycle before reaching the end/restart point.

### Limbs Safety Switch
A limbs safety switch is a device that ensures that the machine operator's hands and feet are away from the dangerous zones of the operated machine. While that condition is not satisfied the machine production cycle can not be started. As described in the **Environment Analysis**, the diverse characteristics of these machines imply that some of them are dangerous for several combinations of limbs, and the **flexible production machine** characteristic of some of them make them a risk source for different limbs depending on the configuration being used for certain operations, and for other limbs when the configuration is changed.


### Emergency signal:
The emergency signal is an internal or external generated notification of a malfunction, anomaly or exception state of the machine. Depending on the characteristics of the machine, as previously stated, the production cycle might be -or not- interrupted in the event of an **Emergency signal**.  
- Internal Emergency Signal: Is generated by the machine by the detection of an anomaly in de production cycle by sensors included or added to it's mechanisms.
- External Emergency Signal: Is generated by the operator, another person or an independent device.  

In the case of uninterruptible cycle machines the only granted "Emergency signal response" possible action sequence would be:
- Signal de Emergency and enter the Emergency state of the machine
- Block the future execution of new production cycles
- Keep the Emergency state including the production cycle blockage until a higher level -Supervisor- clears the Emergency state unblocking the machine use.  

For other kind of cycle machines different 

### Limbs Safety Switch library
The **Limbs Safety Switch library** contains the definition for one or more classes and support code -structures, tasks, timers, etc.- for modeling limbs safety switches for cycle machines. Each class will model a different switch with it's own activation execution and control capabilities depending of the existence or possibilities of addition of sensors and actuators capable of providing information through the cycle execution.

# Limbs Safety for Launch and Forget Switch class (LimbsSftyLnFSwtch)   
The ***LimbsSftyLnFSwtch*** class models a switch for safely activate **"launch and forget" cycle machines** and devices, which originally provides no other mechanism than a latch release mechanical trigger. This means that once activated the machine will complete a production cycle, return to the starting point and wait for a new **Start**|**Release** signal. As such, the minimum security primitive is to ensure no limbs are placed inside any dangerous machine zone before releasing the cycle trigger. The software development will consider then that the physical action needed to release the latch or trigger is replaced with a device such as a electromagnetic pull, an electrovalve commanded pneumatic actuator or similar device with the ability to be temporarily activated by an electric signal. Once the production cycle is started the limbs security will be the same as the one provided by the machine before the electronic upgrade.

## Requirements for the ***LimbsSftySnglShtSw*** class objects:  
The library must model a switch that ensures the hands positioned in a secure place and a foot to be used to activate the release mechanism, so it must include **three inputs** and **one output** in this most basic configuration:
- The first input is a signal ensuring the left hand is placed away from the dangerous mechanisms of the machine.
- The second input is a signal ensuring the right hand is placed away from the dangerous mechanisms of the machine.
- The third input is a signal intended to be originated in a foot press button, to generate the **Start**|**Release** of the production mechanism if the first two inputs signals comply to the configuration established for the object.
- The output generated includes the value setting of an attribute flag, the option of a function execution and the option of a task unblocking to provide a flexible means of activating the release mechanism.

- Inputs/Outputs requirements
   - The **hands switches** must comply with the following required characteristics:  
      - They must ensure a debounced stable signal for a pressing event to be considered valid.  
      - They must ensure a configurable minimum press time before a pressing event is to be considered valid.
      - They must ensure they are not kept pressed down by artificial meanings -tampering, blocking, mocking- bypassing the security purpose of the switch. For fulfilling that end at least two policies must be enforced:
         - The pressing signal will be voided if kept for longer than a configured time lapse, the unvoiding procedure must include the effective releasing of the switch.
         - The switch must be **disabled** after the device activation and for an established period of time, or until a signal is received. The **enabling** procedure must include the effective releasing of the switch.
      - If some kind of device or production demands a hand or both to be freed from the pressing action (based on the physical operation ensuring a hand or both are necessarily kept outside the dangerous areas of the machine), the input must be set to be ignored, or considering the continuous press of the switch as a validating situation.

   - The **foot switch** must comply with the following required characteristics
      - It must ensure a debounced stable signal for a pressing event to be considered valid.  
      - It must ensure a configurable minimum press time before a pressing event is to be considered valid.
      - Must be kept disabled until both hands switches are generating a valid enabling signal.
      - When enabled the hands switches must still be monitored to ensure both keep a valid state, disabling this switch if the situation changes.
      - When enabled and pressed it triggers the machine **Start**|**Release** signal.
      

#### Inputs/Outputs requirements conclusion:
According to the aforementioned requirements the design of the ***LimbsSftySnglShtSw*** should include the **ButtonToSwitch library** defined classes as inputs.
   - A **TmVdblMPBttn** class object for the left hand input.
   - A **TmVdblMPBttn** class object for the right hand input.
   - A **SnglSrvcMPBttn** class object for the foot input.

## Implementation:
### Finite States Machine modeling
As the class is modeled for applications where no other signals -inputs or outputs- are expected once the **"launch and forget" cycle ** starts due to lack of possibilities to install sensors or actuators, the execution logic must be the following:

1. Ensure the placement of the hands, enabling the foot activation sensor.  
2. Ensure the timely activation of the foot sensor.
3. Start the production cycle:
   - Disable the three input signal generators
   - Note: ***Point of no return for any internal or external Emergency signal***
   - Activate the release mechanism
   - Hold the release mechanism activated for a established period of time.
4. Deactivate the release mechanism.
5. Wait for a established period of time to consider the production cycle completed.
6. Consider the production cycle completed. 
   - ***Point of reactivation for any internal or external Emergency signal***
   - Activate "End of cycle" flag, function and/or task (useful for ready alerts, starting wasted waiting timers, cycle counters, etc.)
   - Reset the release and cycle timers
   - Enable the configured hands switches. Restart all the activation parameters for a new production cycle.
